# Leapfrog network challenge

This code takes a network and calculates whether a journey can be completed
between two nodes in under a set number of steps (or leaps).

The number of steps can be adjusted, as well as the nodes to calculate the
shortest path journey between. 

Any network consiting of edges and nodes could be used. This code uses a 
fictional network of places to eat to calculate if a journey could be made
in a lunch break.
